* Water Quality Analysis System

-> Problem Statement
This project analyzes water quality data to assess pollution levels and water safety.

-> Dataset
The dataset contains water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, and other indicators.

-> Approach
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Analysis of key water quality parameters
- Rule-based / threshold-based classification for water safety

-> Tools Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

-> Outcome
The system helps identify critical parameters affecting water quality and supports basic decision-making.

-> Disclaimer
This is an analytical and learning-based project, not a certified environmental assessment tool.
